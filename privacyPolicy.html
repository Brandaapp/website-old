                    We have worked very hard not to collect more information than is needed for a specific function. If you make a reservation on the BranVan, we collect your first name and email address, If you make a request to Brandeis Facilities Services, we will pass your first name and email address to Brandeis Facilities Service. If you tell us about a bug (thank you!!!), we will record your email address to allow us to report back to you. For the most part, however, we record only non-identifiable data, such as keeping track of how many users are on each of our pages at any time without seeing any other personally identifiable information. This is all of the personal information we collect, and we will delete it within a week if you ask us to. We will keep you updated as this policy changes, and we are bound to it in perpetuity.
